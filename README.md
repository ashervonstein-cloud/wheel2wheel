## How to Set Up (Step by Step)

### Step 1 — Install the tools you need

You'll need two programs installed on your computer:

1. **Node.js** (runs JavaScript) → https://nodejs.org — download the "LTS" version
2. **PostgreSQL** (the database) → https://www.postgresql.org/download/

> Alternatively, use a hosted database like [Neon](https://neon.tech) (free tier available) — 
> they give you a connection string without installing anything locally.

### Step 2 — Download and open this project

If you received this as a zip file, unzip it. Then open your terminal (Mac: search "Terminal", 
Windows: search "Command Prompt") and navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd path/to/wheel2wheel
```

### Step 3 — Install project dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This downloads all the libraries the project needs. It may take a minute.

### Step 4 — Set up your environment variables

Copy the example file and fill it in:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` in any text editor and fill in:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:yourpassword@localhost:5432/wheel2wheel"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="any-long-random-string-here"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

For `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, just type any random string of letters and numbers (20+ characters).

### Step 5 — Create the database

If using local PostgreSQL, first create the database:
```bash
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE wheel2wheel;"
```

Then run this to create all the tables:
```bash
npm run db:push
```

### Step 6 — Add sample data (optional but recommended for testing)

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

This creates:
- Admin account: `admin@wheel2wheel.com` / `admin123`
- Player account: `player@example.com` / `player123`
- A sample race open for picks

### Step 7 — Start the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:3000**

## How the Game Works (for admins)

### Each race week:

1. **Create the race** → Go to Admin → Create Race
   - Fill in the race name, dates, and the 3 driver matchups
   - Check "Double Points Week" to add a 4th bonus matchup

2. **Open submissions** → Admin → All Races → "Open for Picks"
   - Players can now make their selections

3. **Close submissions** → When qualifying starts → "Close Submissions"
   - No more picks accepted

4. **Enter results** → After the race → "Enter Results"
   - Click which driver won each matchup
   - Hit "Process Results" — points are automatically calculated and awarded

### Scoring:
- 1 correct pick = 1 point
- 2 correct picks = 3 points  
- 3 correct picks = 6 points
- All correct on a double points week = doubled!

### Boosts (player-controlled double points)

Each team gets **2 Boosts per season**. A Boost doubles every point that team
scores in one race of their choosing.

- Spend one from the Picks page while selections are open.
- It can be withdrawn any time before selections close.
- Nobody else sees it until picks lock; after that everyone sees who boosted.
- Boosts cannot be spent on a race you've marked as a Double Points Week —
  the button is disabled with the reason shown.
- If a team boosts a race but submits no picks, the Boost is returned when
  results are processed rather than wasted on a zero.

The limit lives in `src/lib/scoring.ts` as `BOOSTS_PER_SEASON`; change it there
and every screen follows.

## Common Issues

**"Cannot connect to database"**  
→ Make sure PostgreSQL is running and your `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` is correct.

**"Invalid invite code" when joining a league**  
→ Invite codes are case-sensitive. Make sure you're copying the full code.

**I forgot the admin password**  
→ Run `npm run db:seed` again — it will reset the seed accounts.

**The app shows "No race open for picks"**  
→ An admin needs to create a race and click "Open for Picks".
